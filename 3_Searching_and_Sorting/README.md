# Searching_and_Sorting

There are three algorithm techniques that you can use to tackle a wide range
of algorithm challenges. With these techniques, you can traverse different
data structures in a linear and non-linear way, which provides you with
more capability in finding creative solutions for complex problems. These
techniques include:

    • Two Pointers Approach.
    • Breadth-First Search Approach (BFS).
    • Depth-First Search Approach (DFS).
